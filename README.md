# Tokenvm Subnet using the Avalanche HyperSDK

The tokenvm using the Avalanche HyperSDK allows anyone create any asset, mint more of their asset, modify the metadata of their asset (if they reveal some info), and burn their asset. Additionally, there is an embedded on-chain exchange that allows anyone to create orders and fill (partial) orders of anyone else. To make this example easy to play with, the tokenvm also bundles a powerful CLI tool and serves RPC requests for trades out of an in-memory order book it maintains by syncing blocks.
